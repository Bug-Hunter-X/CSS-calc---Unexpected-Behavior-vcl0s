The CSS property `calc()` is used to perform calculations, but it can produce unexpected results if not used carefully. For example, using `calc(100% - 50px)` might not subtract 50px from 100% of the *containing element's width*, but from 100% of the element's own width. This can lead to unexpected layout issues.  Another example is improper use of units within the `calc()` function; mixing units inconsistently can result in errors.
